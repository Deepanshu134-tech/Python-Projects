# Python-Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects completed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming, problem-solving, and real-world application development under the guidance of Cognifyz.

Projects Overview
1. Calculator Program
A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Skills Used: Python basics, user input handling, conditional statements.

2. Email Validator
Validates email addresses using regex (regular expressions) to check for correct formatting.

Skills Used: String manipulation, regex, input validation.

3. Fibonacci Sequence
Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined limit, showcasing recursion or iterative approaches.

Skills Used: Loops, recursion, mathematical logic.

4. File Manipulation
Performs file operations (create, read, write, append) on text files, demonstrating basic I/O handling.

Skills Used: File handling (open(), read(), write()), exception handling.

5. Guessing Game / Number Guesser
An interactive number-guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a range.

Skills Used: Random module, loops, user interaction.

6. Palindrome Checker
Checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

Skills Used: String slicing, loops, conditional checks.

7. Password Strength Checker
Evaluates password strength based on length, special characters, and complexity.

Skills Used: String validation, conditional logic.

8. String Reversal
Reverses a given string using Python slicing or iterative methods.

Skills Used: String manipulation, loops.

9. Temperature Conversion
Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

Skills Used: Mathematical operations, user input handling.

10. Web Scraper Tool
A basic web scraper that extracts data from a webpage using libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup.

Skills Used: Web scraping, HTTP requests, HTML parsing.

Key Learnings
Strengthened core Python programming concepts.

Gained hands-on experience with file handling, regex, loops, and user input validation.

Improved debugging and logical problem-solving skills.

Explored real-world applications like web scraping and data validation.
